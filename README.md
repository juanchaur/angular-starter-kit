# Angular StarterKit

The Angular StarterKit sets up a basic navigation-style architecture for you along with some basic screens. You can create your own screens by only creating modules and views and creating the state for it.

This StarterKit comes with

 * [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/)
 * [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#overview) (SCSS)
 * [ui-router](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router)
 

A test-suite is now set-up
